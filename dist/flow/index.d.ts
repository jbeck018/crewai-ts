/**
 * Flow system for orchestrating workflows with harmonized API between Python and TypeScript.
 *
 * Performance optimizations include:
 * - Multi-level caching with O(1) lookups and TTL-based expiration
 * - Memory-efficient data structures using WeakMap for automatic garbage collection
 * - Parallel method execution with Promise.all for maximum throughput
 * - Optimized string handling with Set for deduplication
 * - Type-safe interfaces with proper validation for cross-language compatibility
 * - Smart event propagation with minimal overhead
 * - Cache size estimation for memory management
