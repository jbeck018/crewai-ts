# Core Concepts

This section covers the fundamental concepts and components of the CrewAI TypeScript implementation, with a focus on the performance optimizations and memory-efficient patterns unique to the TypeScript version.

## Available Documentation

### Agent System

Learn about the autonomous agents that form the foundation of CrewAI, including their memory-optimized implementation in TypeScript:

- [Memory Systems](memory-systems.html) - Comprehensive guide to the memory system components and optimizations
- [Flows](flows.html) - Learn about the powerful Flow system for creating AI workflows
- [Knowledge System](knowledge-system.html) - Optimized knowledge retrieval and integration
- [LLM Integrations](llm-integrations.html) - TypeScript-specific optimizations for LLM interactions
- [Flow Performance Guide](flow-performance-guide.html) - Advanced techniques for optimizing Flow performance

## Memory Optimization Highlights

The TypeScript implementation includes several key optimizations not available in the Python version:

- **Float32Array for Embeddings**: 50% memory reduction compared to standard arrays
- **LRU Caching**: Efficient caching mechanisms to reduce duplicate operations
- **Lazy-loaded LLM Clients**: Initialize components only when needed
- **Incremental State Updates**: Minimize memory footprint during flow execution
- **Smart Batching**: Optimal request handling for better performance
- **Optimized Retry Logic**: Better error handling with exponential backoff
- **Tiered Memory Architecture**: Hot/warm/cold storage patterns for efficient memory usage

These optimizations are documented throughout this section to help you build memory-efficient and high-performance applications with CrewAI TypeScript.
